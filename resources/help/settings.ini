[overview]
content = "<p>This screen provides access to the Background Manager settings, where you can customize how the background appears on your website.</p>

<p>A <em>Background Image Set</em> must first be created by selecting <strong>Add New Image Set</strong>, or via the <strong>Image Sets</strong> menu option. An
image from the active <em>Background Image Set</em> can be displayed as the background during each browser session (that is, until
the visitor closes the browser entirely), on each new page or page refresh, or at a specified interval. The background image can also appear
on only specific pages, such as single posts or the front page, by selecting the appropriate checkboxes.</p>

<p>The order in which the images are selected as the background image can be random, or if the background is updated at a specified interval,
in ascending or descending order. The actual order of the images can be changed when editing an <em>Image Set</em>.</p>

<p>The background image can be displayed full screen, which maintains the aspect ratio of the image, and allow you to select an optional
opacity as well as scaling. You can also specify positioning, tiling, scrolling and stretching if you wish to have more control over how
the background image is displayed.</p>

<p>If the background image is displayed in full screen and the background image changes at a specified interval, it will also be possible
to set the background transitioning. This defines how each new background image will replace the previous one, such as by
crossfading or sliding, and how long this transition effect is to take.</p>

<p>Using one of the pre-defined <em>Background Overlays</em>, you can add additional visual appeal to the displayed background image,
without modifying any of the images directly.</p>

<p>It is also possible to present more information about the background image to the visitor. A small <code>[ + ]</code> icon will appear
in one of the selected corners, which will display a short description and/or thumbnail of the background when hovered over with the mouse.
A linked icon will allow the visitor to click on the icon and view the image in more detail, possibly commenting on it (depending on WordPress settings).</p>"

[individual]
title = "Individual Settings"
content = "<p>It is possible to change the <em>Background Image Set</em>, <em>Background Overlay</em> and <em>Color</em>for each individual post, page, category or tag.</p>

<h3>Override per Post or Page</h3>
<p>When adding or editing a post or page, the option to override these settings can be found underneath the main text editor, in a box named <em>Background</em>. If the box is not visible, ensure it is enbaled by clicking the <em>Customize</em> tab in the upper-right corner (while editing the post/page), and selecting the option <em>Background</em>.</p>

<h3>Override per Category or Tag</h3>
<p>Overriding per Category or Tag can be done by editing an <em>Image Set</em>, which provides the options in the right side-bar. If these options are not visible, ensure they are enabled by clicking the <em>Customize</em> tab in the upper-right corner, and selecting <em>Override by Category</em> and/or <em>Override by Tag</em>.</p>"

[tracking]
title = "Tracking Background Impressions and Clicks"
content = "<p>If the background image has an associated URL link, it is possible to track impressions and clicks using Google Analytics. If you are already using Google Analytics for your website, simply enabling the <em>Track Background Links</em> setting and optionally providing a category name is sufficient.</p>

<p>If you are not Google Analytics, you first need to <a href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics/\" target=\"_blank\">obtain a free account</a>. This will also guide you through adding the Google Analytics code to your website -- no special options or settings are required for that code for tracking to work.</p>

<p>Any time a visitor clicks on the background, it will be recorded as a <a href=\"http://support.google.com/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1033068\" target=\"_blank\">Google Analytics event</a>. These events can be used in <a href=\"http://support.google.com/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1032415\" target=\"_blank\">Goals</a>.</p>

<p>The event category is \"Background Manager\" by default, and can be changed in the provided field. There are two reported events: <em>Display</em> and <em>Click</em>, to track impressions and clickthroughs respectively. <em><strong>Note:</strong> Only images which have an associated URL link will be tracked in the Display event</em>. The event label is the URL of the link itself.</p>"
